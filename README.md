# Digit-Classification-Logistic-Reg

load_digits is a dataset in the sci-kit learn library of python which basically is made up of 1797 8x8 images. Each image is of a hand-written digit.
Using Logistic Regression, my aim was to recognize the handwritten digits in the dataset. The model which I made is 98% accurate and this repository consists of the code for the same.

To analyze the areas where the model could not perform correct predictions, Confusion matrix was used.
The confusion matrix is a table that describes a classification models performance on a set of test data for the known true values. In order to create a confusion matrix with the digits dataset, Matplotlib and seaborn libraries will be used to make a confusion matrix.
Seaborn library provided an amazing visualization of the accuracy of our model.
